IN THAT WAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO EVEN HAVE THE WINDOW IN-FRONT TO KNOW WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

-FIX THE ICON BECAUSE ITS SORTA FUGLY.

-ADD A DYNAMIC AUTO-UPDATER LABEL THAT WILL REFRESH THE AOID LIST EVERY X MS, SO THAT WAY YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO RE-LAUNCH THE
APPLICATION AFTER LOADING YOUR AO WINDOWS. MAKE IT BASED OFF OF THE INI FILE, SO IT CAN BE ADJUSTED. (THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT
THE QUICKLAUNCH BUTTONS FOR AO WILL NOT BE ANNOYING TO USE)

-INCLUDE AN OPTION TO SAVE VALUES FROM THE GUI DIRECTLY INTO THE INI FILE, TO OVER-WRITE ANYTHING INSIDE OF THERE.
SO YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO OPEN THE INI FILE, JUST PRESS THE "SAVE VALUES" BUTTON IN THE GUI TO WRITE ALL CURRENT SPEEDS TO INI.

-ADD AN INPUTBOX THAT LETS YOU SPECIFY YOUR RAIDLEADER RIGHT THERE IN THE GUI.
